				<p>Son Goku is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the
					Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.
					He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King
					in the West), a main character of the classic Chinese novel Journey to
					the West (16th century), combined with influences from the Hong Kong
					martial arts films of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku first made his
					debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku,
					originally published in Japan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on
					December 3, 1984.[2] Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed
					boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength.
					He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the wish-granting
					seven Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him
					on his journey to become a stronger fighter. As Goku grows up, he becomes
					the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with
					the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the
					process.</p>
